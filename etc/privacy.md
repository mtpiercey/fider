If you have any questions or concerns about our policies or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us using the e-mail [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca).

When you visit the Bot-In-a-Box Idea Portal at [https://botinabox-fider.herokuapp.com](https://botinabox-fider.herokuapp.com), and use our services, you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. We hope you take the small amount of time it takes to thoroughly read through this privacy policy, as it will help you make informed decisions dealing with how to use our site. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our website and our services.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through the "Idea Portal" (the site at [https://botinabox-fider.herokuapp.com](https://botinabox-fider.herokuapp.com)), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (referred to in this policy as “our activities”).

## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?  

### Information automatically collected 

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate our site. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your public Internet Protocol address, web browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, device name, country, approximate location, information about how and when you use our site, and other technical information. This information is primarily collected to maintain the security and operation of our site, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. For example, we use Google Analytics to track your journey through our site, in order to see whence our visitors originate, and what pages are the most accessed, etc. Again, none of the information collected automatically contains personally-identifying characteristics.

### Information related to newsletter registration

If you agree to sign up for our e-newsletter or any such promotional/communication material from us, we collect your name and e-mail address.

### Information collected upon account creation

When you "Sign In" to the Idea Portal, using your e-mail (or GitHub account via [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/), you agree for us to collect your name and e-mail address in order to create an account for you on the Idea Portal. By default, we will select the photo provided by [https://gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com) for your e-mail address - if one exists - as your profile picture.

If you choose to delete your account, the comments, posts, and other publicly-accessible data you put on the Idea Portal will still be available, albeit anonymously.

## HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?  

We use personal information collected via our site for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations. We indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.  

### We use the information we collect or receive:     

#### To send you marketing and promotional communications. 
If you agree to sign up for our e-newsletter, we use your name and e-mail address to send you personalized e-mails on a recurring basis. You can unsubscribe from these e-mail messages at any time by using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of them.    

#### To protect our site. 
We may use some of the information we collect from you as part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention). The information used for these purposes is non-personal, related to usage statistics and technical specifications related to your web browsing system.                      

#### To enforce our terms, conditions and policies.

#### To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. 
If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.                          

#### For other business purposes. 
We may use your information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our site, products, services, marketing and your experience of them. We do not share any of the information used for these particular purposes.                          

## WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?  
We may process or share data based on the following legal bases:

### Consent: 
We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose. 

### Legitimate Interests: 
We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests. 

### Performance of a Contract: 
If we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract. 

### Legal Obligations: 
We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). 

### Vital Interests: 
We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. 

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following two types of situations:   

#### Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers
We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service. However, unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.   

#### Business Transfers
We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.            

## WHO WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH?  

We only share and disclose your information with the following third parties. We have categorized each party so that you may easily understand the purpose of our data collection and processing practices. If we have processed your data based on your consent and you wish to revoke your consent, please contact us.  

### Content Optimization for Google’s Web Crawlers
Google Site Search

### Web and Mobile Analytics
Google Analytics

### Web/Postgres Database Hosting
Heroku

It’s worth noting for the first two parties in the list above, the information that is shared is non-personal, pertaining to approximate location and usage metrics.

Any information stored on Heroku's servers will be in a private, key-encrypted Postgres database.
    

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?  

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until complete deletion is possible.

## HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?   

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please remember that we cannot guarantee that any use of the Internet to access our site is ever 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our site is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment, using a modern web browser with the capacity to use the HTTPS (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure) version of our site using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for industry-standard security

## DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?  

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Idea Portal, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor, and you consent to such minor dependent’s use of the site. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at matthew@botinabox.ca.  

## WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?  

You may review, change, or terminate your account on this site at any time. If you do that, we will do our best to purge our systems of your personal data. If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm       

## CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES  

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy. 

## DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?  

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided at the end of this policy. However, we do not disclose any information for direct marketing purposes, but you still have the right to ask anyway.

## DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?  

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by a changed “Last Updated” date at the top of the Privacy Policy section of this page, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes, or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

# Terms of Service
## Last Updated: June 15, 2019

The Bot-In-a-Box Idea Portal (the "Idea Portal”) is provided as an information portal and communications gateway. Please read these terms carefully.

## Terms: 
By accessing the Idea Portal via TCP/IP at https://botinabox-ideas.herokuapp.com, you are agreeing to be bound by the most-current terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing our Website.

## Use License: 
Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on the Idea Portal for personal, non-commercial, transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not: modify or copy the materials; use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial); attempt to decompile or reverse-engineer any software contained on our Website; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics at any time. Upon terminating your session of viewing these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format (note that this does not apply to cached copies stored in web browsers for quick access).

## Disclaimer: 
The materials on the Idea Portal are provided on an ‘as-is’ basis. Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

Furthermore, Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on the Idea Portal or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to the Idea Portal.

## Ownership of Ideas

By commenting on an idea, posting an idea, or otherwise adding content to the Idea Portal, please note that you are submitting your ideas to Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics on a non-confidential basis.

You agree by using the Idea Portal that any information you submit (aside from personal information necessary to create an account on the Idea Portal, of course) is given to Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics non-commercially, and that the ownership, employees, and open-source contributors associated with Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics can use it in any way they please. That is not to say that Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics will not credit those involved in the creation, distribution, and influence of new Ideas on the Idea Portal, however. Whenever possible, within the realm of reason, Bot-In-a-Box will indeed make an effort to credit such parties, in the spirit of open-source development and collaboration.

## Limitations: 
In no event shall Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the Idea Portal, even if Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics or a Bot-In-a-Box’s authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

## Indemnification: 
By using the Idea Portal, you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics, its employees, affiliates, suppliers, owners, funders, and suppliers from any claims, losses, liabilities, demands, and expenses (including reasonable lawyer’s fees) related to (a) your use of our Website; or (b) violations of these Terms of Service.

## Accuracy of Materials: 
The materials appearing on the Idea Portal could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics does not warrant that any of the materials on the Idea Portal are accurate, complete or current. Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics may make changes to the materials contained on the Idea Portal at any time without notice. However, Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics does not make any legal commitment to update the materials. This site is updated when new/corrected information is deemed available, not necessarily when it truly is new/corrected.

## Links: 
Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics has not reviewed all of the sites linked to the Idea Portal and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics of the site to which the link refers. Use of any such linked website is at the user’s own risk.

## Modifications: 
Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics may revise these terms of service for its Idea Portal at any time without notice. By using the Idea Portal you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

## Governing Law: 
These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the government of Canada and the province of Ontario.
